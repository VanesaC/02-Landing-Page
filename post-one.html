          <h1>The influence of modern art</h1>
          <h2>The first two decades of the twentieth century were a time
              of ferment and change that radically altered all aspects of the
              human condition.
          </h2>
          <p>
              The social, political, cultural, and economic
              character of life was caught in fluid upheaval. In Europe, monarchy was replaced by democracy, socialism, and communism.
              Technology and scientific advances transformed commerce
              and industry. Transportation was radically altered by the
              coming of the motorcar (1885) and the airplane (1903). The
              motion picture (1896) and wireless radio transmission (1895)
              foretold a new era of human communications.

              Beginning in
              1908, with the Turkish revolution that restored constitutional
              government and the Bulgarian declaration of independence,
              colonized and subjugated peoples began to awaken and
              demand independence.

              The slaughter during the first of two
              global wars, fought with the destructive weapons of technology, shook the traditions and institutions of Western civilization to their foundations.
              Amidst this turbulence, it is not surprising that visual art
              and design experienced a series of creative revolutions that
              questioned long-held values and approaches to organizing
              space as well as the role of art and design in society. The
              traditional objective view of the world was shattered.

              The representation of external appearances did not fulfill the needs
              and vision of the emerging European avant-garde.
